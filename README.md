# Python-Projects

Welcome to my playground of Python experiments, where code meets caffeine, and AI occasionally tries to take over.

This repository is a collection of projects inspired by my coursework at Kozminski University, where Iâ€™m pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s in Management & AI. Some of the courses that shaped these projects include:

Big Data and Algorithms â€“ Because size matters.
Introduction to Python and Machine Learning â€“ The class where "print('Hello, World!')" turned into "let's predict the future."
Statistics for Machine Learning â€“ Making numbers do magic tricks.
Advanced Python â€“ Where Python gets dangerous.
Social Networks Analysis with API â€“ Spying on data (legally).
Methods of Data Visualization â€“ Because ugly charts hurt my soul.
Currently, I'm diving into front-end development with WordPress while keeping my Python skills sharp. Expect a mix of AI experiments, data wizardry, and the occasional attempt at making machines understand sarcasm.

Stay tuned, and if you see something weird in my codeâ€”it's either a feature or an AI uprising in progress. ðŸš€ðŸ˜Ž
