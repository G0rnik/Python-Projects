# Cats-vs-Dogs-Differing-Model

This project is a deep learning-based image classification model that can distinguish between cats and dogs with (hopefully) impressive accuracy. Inspired by my coursework at Kozminski University, this model is part of my AI and Python journey.

#📌 Features

-   Trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN)
-   Dataset preprocessing & augmentation for better accuracy
-   Model evaluation with validation & test sets
-   Built with TensorFlow/Keras (or the library you used)
-   Simple web/app integration for real-time predictions (if applicable)

#🚀 How It Works

- Feed an image of a cat or dog into the model.
- The neural network processes the image and makes a prediction.
- Get a confidence score indicating whether it's a 🐱 or 🐶.

#📂 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable)
- OpenCV/Pillow for image processing
- NumPy & Pandas for data handling

#📢 Why This Project?

Because the internet is 90% cats and dogs, and it's about time AI learned to tell them apart.
